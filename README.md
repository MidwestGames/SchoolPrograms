### What is this
This is my repository for any programs I write in my classes. As of now, I only have the Aerodynamics calculator we are required to write for my aerodynimcs courses. Eventually, I will be adding in all of the repositories of our computational science course I have taken. This is all in `C`, but has some very useful tips and tricks.
